# Bank_loan-SQL-project
Project Overview
This project is focused on building a comprehensive data analytics pipeline using SQL, with the integration of Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases. The main objective is to guide users through real-world SQL queries and address business problems through data analytics and visualizations using tools like Power BI and Tableau.

Project Steps
Data Import and Database Setup

Begin by importing financial loan data, consisting of 38,577 rows and 24 fields, into SQL Server databases. Each record holds information about loan applications, customer details, and repayment statuses. Learn how to create and prepare databases for analytics.

SQL Queries for Business Problems

Execute SQL queries to solve business problems through project-based learning. Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) like total loan applications, funded amounts, and customer repayment data. Identify trends and critical factors such as loan performance, interest rates, and customers' financial health.

Integration with Dashboard Tools

Build dynamic dashboards using Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to visualize insights from SQL queries. Translate my findings into clear summaries and key metrics for stakeholders. Focus on:

Loan performance across different regions

Monthly trends of loan issues

Comparative analysis of good vs. bad loans

KPI summaries like debt-to-income ratios, average interest rates, and more

Tools & Technologies
Databases: Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL

Software Versions: MS SQL Server (19.0), Power BI (June 2023)

Key Functionalities
SQL query writing (joins, subqueries, analytical functions)

Database design and management

Business analysis through SQL-driven insights

Handling large datasets and deriving KPIs for business solutions

Problem Statements
Address several business problems, such as:

Loan Application Analysis: Identify the total number of loan applications received and funded, along with repayment status.

Good vs. Bad Loans: Segregate loans into good (fully paid or in progress) and bad (defaulted) categories, and analyze the percentage funded versus repaid.

Regional and Trend Analysis: Create dashboards that show regional loan performance and trends over time.

Expected Outcomes
Its applications are in real-world data analytics, and it is proficient in building professional dashboards to communicate insights effectively.
